Greymon is a **Virus-type** Digimon, which makes it weak against Vaccine-type Digimon. Make sure to assemble a team of Vaccine Digimon to gain the upperhand.

Greymon is also weak to **Water, Ice, Electricity, and Null** elements, so set up your team according to most if not all of these elements.

#### Switch to Reserve Digimon to Attack Head Shell

### Recommended Digimon Attacking Head Shell

Greymon's Head Shell has different elemental resistances, forcing you to consider switching to more-compatible Digimon units. Switch to Digimon that can effectively attack the Head Shell with **Plant, Wind, and Light** damage.

#### Use a Damaging Cross Art on Head Shell

Since your Digimon may not be as powerful at this point in the game, equip a **damage-dealing Cross Art** to attack Greymon's Head Shell when it begins to charge up its strong attack. Consider equipping **Cross Art: Burst** or **Cross Art: Strike** to do the trick.

This should also be helped by Minervamon dealing the bulk of your team's damage.

#### Avoid Using Digimon Weak to Earth

Greymon's **Awesome Quake** attack deals multi-target **Earth damage** to your Digimon. It would be beneficial to have a team of Digimon that is not weak to Earth.
