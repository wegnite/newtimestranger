#### Use Fire and Steel Attacks

As Cherrymon is a **Virus** Digimon, it is weak to **Vaccine** types. It also takes increased damage from **Fire and Steel** elemental attacks.

#### Bring Poison Recovery Items

Cherrymon's **Cherry Bomb** attack deals AoE Poison damage to your team. To immediately undo its effects, use Poison Recovery items. Alternatively, you can use the **Meditator** skill if equipped on a Digimon beforehand.

#### Prioritize Defeating Okuwamon

Because Okuwamon will continuously summon allies after you defeat them, it is best to **quickly defeat Okuwamon** to immediately end the battle.

#### Use Electricity and Earth Attacks

Okuwamon is a Virus-type Digimon, making it weak to **Vaccine** Digimon. It is also mainly weak to **Electricity and Earth** elemental attacks.
