Hagurumon will speak to you first before you are allowed to enter and go up higher into the tower. At the end of the platform, climb the ladder. |
| 5 | ![Carry Hagurumon to Cog](/images/walkthorough/c9367bfa86257eba.webp) After climbing another ladder going up another platform, you will see a Hagurumon and a cog to put it into. Carry the Hagurumon to the cog to lower the bridge. Climb the ladder at the end of the platform. |

The elevator to the left of the cog cannot be accessed yet. Take the elevator to the right to descend to where the third Hagurumon is. Take it from its cog and go back up again to fit it into the cog there. This will bring the left elevator down, allowing you to take it going up. |

#### Use Weaknesses Against Parrotmon and Its Crest

Parrotmon and its crest **have different weaknesses**, so consider assembling a team of Digimon with the right elements to attack it with. Parrotmon is weak to **Fire and Earth** attacks while its crest is especially weak to **Water, Ice, Light, and Null** attacks.

#### Prepare Paralysis Recovery Items

Parrotmon's Electricity attacks can apply the **Paralysis** effect on your Digimon, forcing them to skip a turn. Prepare Paralysis Recovery in advance to immediately remove the effect.

#### Use Buffs and Debuffs

You can turn the battle to your favor by taking advantage of your Digimon's buff and debuff skills, minimizing the effectiveness of Parrotmon's attacks.
