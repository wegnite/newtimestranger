#### Defeat Fugamon First

Prioritize beating Fugamon first as it **has the least number of HP** of the three. Later, focus on defeating Hyogamon next and then Ogremon last.

#### Use Digimon That Target All Weaknesses

### Boss

### Attribute Weakness

### Elemental Weakness

- Vaccine
- Water, Ice

- ![[Ogremon](/games/Digimon-Story-Time-Stranger/archives/555145#hl_1) Boss](https://img.game8.co/4297220/0a083fb9f0a429fc4151e116ef851031.png/show) Ogremon
- Fire, Earth

- ![[Hyogamon](/games/Digimon-Story-Time-Stranger/archives/555361#hl_1) Boss](https://img.game8.co/4297221/33cf5178b24e0408b2ed1c9008cdb145.png/show) Hyogamon
- Fire, Steel

Three of the bosses **have their own elemental weaknesses** but are mutually weak to Vaccine Digimon. Try to assemble a team of Vaccine Digimon that targets all their elemental weaknesses.

#### Use Cross Arts to Defeat Bosses Faster

Because there are three bosses, equip offensive Cross Arts like **Cross Art: Strike**. Otherwise, you may use Cross Arts that buff your team's damage, like **Cross Art: Field**.

#### Use Aegiomon's Stun Beat Blow Skill

Halfway through the battle, Aegiomon will learn the **Stun Beat Blow** skill. Capitalize on this skill to deal immense damage to the bosses while applying the **Paralysis** effect.
