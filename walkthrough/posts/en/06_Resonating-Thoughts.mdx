Open it by using DigiAttack with electricity on the nearby machine. You can convert the Betamon in this area, as it has an electricity skill by default. Alternatively, you can equip a Digimon with an attachment skill that has electricity to achieve the same effect.▶︎ [How to Use Electricity to Open the Shutter](#hm_101) |

#### Weak Against Vaccine Type Digimon

### Recommended Digimon

- ![[Agumon](https://game8.co/games/Digimon-Story-Time-Stranger/archives/555161) Image](https://img.game8.co/4294384/594b563b0d06347e199b7ea6bac9b8b9.png/show) Agumon
- ![[Monodramon](https://game8.co/games/Digimon-Story-Time-Stranger/archives/555194) Image](https://img.game8.co/4295337/caa628383b32d78b0b9b554caffdf06a.png/show) Monodramon
- ![[Tentomon](https://game8.co/games/Digimon-Story-Time-Stranger/archives/555203) Image](https://img.game8.co/4294680/62747af3d05fd777296ca58a5227ebab.png/show) Tentomon

- ![[Patamon](https://game8.co/games/Digimon-Story-Time-Stranger/archives/555144) Image](https://img.game8.co/4294388/43e8fee6038b629aba3a4873a3ba1b7e.png/show) Patamon
- ![[Gaomon](https://game8.co/games/Digimon-Story-Time-Stranger/archives/555191) Image](https://img.game8.co/4295507/e8f549389d8d894a2629a5017e2d22ea.png/show) Gaomon

Cyclonemon is a Virus Type Digimon, making it vulnerable to Vaccine Types such as **Agumon**, **Monodramon**, and **Tentomon**. Bringing these Digimon will give you a natural advantage in the fight.

Additionally, it is also weak to **Ice** and **Wind** elements so Digimon like Patamon or Gaomon that have wind special skills will also prove helpful. Lastly, you can also consider equipping attachment skills to your Digimon such as Icicle Edge or Wind Claw to capitalize on the Vaccine Type digimon advantage.

#### Use Aegiomon's Taunt to Tank Damage

You will also have Aegiomon as a guest Digimon in the battle and his special move is Attract Echo that will apply Taunting to himself and force enemies to target him with their attacks.

Use this to your advantage and lessen the damage your party takes by making Cyclonemon focus Aegiomon with its hits. Additionally, Attract Echo also provides 30% bonus evasion which can let Aegiomon completely nullify Cyclonemon's attacks randomly.
