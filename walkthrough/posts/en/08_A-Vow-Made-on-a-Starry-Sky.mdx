#### Bring Vaccine and Data Type Digimon

### Recommended Digimon

- ![[Agumon](https://game8.co/games/Digimon-Story-Time-Stranger/archives/555161) Image](https://img.game8.co/4294384/594b563b0d06347e199b7ea6bac9b8b9.png/show) Agumon
- ![[Biyomon](https://game8.co/games/Digimon-Story-Time-Stranger/archives/555199) Image](https://img.game8.co/4294391/df23149f85981f5cbb8c65ff6264366a.png/show) Biyomon
- ![[Monodramon](https://game8.co/games/Digimon-Story-Time-Stranger/archives/555194) Image](https://img.game8.co/4295337/caa628383b32d78b0b9b554caffdf06a.png/show) Monodramon

- ![[Gotsumon](https://game8.co/games/Digimon-Story-Time-Stranger/archives/555186) Image](https://img.game8.co/4294392/7efbefdf8b3d5af1055ed466999f6178.png/show) Gotsumon
- ![[Gaomon](https://game8.co/games/Digimon-Story-Time-Stranger/archives/555191) Image](https://img.game8.co/4295507/e8f549389d8d894a2629a5017e2d22ea.png/show) Gaomon
- ![[Kamemon](https://game8.co/games/Digimon-Story-Time-Stranger/archives/555188) Image](https://img.game8.co/4294382/1ccf7b629136f2a58cf81614f9e90c18.png/show) Kamemon

Vademon is initially weak to Vaccine types so **Agumon**, **Biyomon**, and **Monodramon** can be your primary damage dealers for the first half of the fight. Agumon and Biyomon's Fire skills will be especially helpful against Vademon's **Fire** weakness.

Once Vademon uses its Character Reversal, it becomes weak to **Data** digimon instead. When this happens, swap out to digimon like **Gotsumon**, **Gaomon**, and **Kamemon**. Have them equip **Plant** or **Ice** skills to take advantage of Vademon's reversed elemental resistances.

#### Taunt with Aegiomon's Attract Echo

You can make Aegiomon tank most of Vademon's attacks by using their **Attract Echo** skill. This will allow your other digimon to **focus on dealing damage** to Vademon!

#### Bring Sprite Recovery Items

Vademon has a skill that can turn your digimon into sprites, which prevents them from using skills. To remedy this, try to prepare Sprite Recovery Items before the fight.
