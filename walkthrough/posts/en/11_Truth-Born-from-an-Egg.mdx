#### Use Fire and Light Attacks

As a Virus type, Titamon is weak to Vaccine Digimon. Assemble your team according to this attribute and take advantage of Titamon's weakness to **Fire and Light** damage as well.

#### Equip Offensive or Defensive Cross Arts

You will want to focus on dealing as much damage to Titamon, so consider equipping an offensive ability like **Cross Art: Strike** to take out some of Titamon's HP.

Alternatively, you can play defensively by equipping **Cross Art: Field** to protect your team from Titamon's Soul Core Attack.

#### Use Buffs and Debuffs

Consider assembling a team of Digimon with **buff and debuff capabilities** to weaken Titamon or reduce the effectiveness of its attacks.

#### Play Your Moves Carefully

As Titamon is a challenging boss at this stage, you will have to consider playing carefully to win the battle. Prepare **Recovery items** in advance to heal your Digimon and restore their SP. It is also helpful to assemble your team with **a Digimon that can heal** its teammates.

Also remember to **guard** against Titamon's powerful moves, especially its **Soul Core Attack**.
