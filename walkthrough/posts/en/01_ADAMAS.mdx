#### Selecting Your Initial Digimon Partner

When choosing your starting Digimon, **Patamon** stands out as the most versatile option for new players. This creature's evolution paths typically lead to **Vaccine** and **Data** types, giving you an edge against many early bosses. Patamon also offers access to evolution lines with **healing skills** and **strong SPI stats**, making it an excellent choice for developing a reliable support Digimon as you progress through the game.
