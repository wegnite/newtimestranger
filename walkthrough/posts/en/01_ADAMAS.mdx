This Digimon's evolutionary paths predominantly favor **Vaccine** and **Data** classifications, providing significant advantages against numerous early-game adversaries. Additionally, Patamon possesses access to multiple evolution lines featuring **healing abilities** and **superior SPI statistics**, enabling you to cultivate it into a dependable support companion for future encounters.
