| 5 | ![Forgotten Rails](/images/walkthorough/cc4f3a8ec8f97f2d.webp) Continue through the Forgotten Rails. Here, you will learn how to battle and use DigiAttack. You can also find several lootable items in this area. |
| 6 | ![MetalGreymon chase scene](/images/walkthorough/f6f4160601fbcc0c.webp) In the next area, use DigiAttack to clear the debris and proceed. You will then be chased by MetalGreymon. Keep moving away until a Mysterious Girl rescues you in a cutscene. After the cutscene, the mission will be completed. |

#### Choosing Your Starting Digimom

If you want flexibility and long-term utility, **Patamon** is the safest choice. Its evolutions often lean toward **Vaccine** and **Data** attributes, which give you an advantage against many early bosses. Patamon also has access to several lines with **healing skills** and **good SPI stats**, letting you develop it into a reliable support Digimon later on.
