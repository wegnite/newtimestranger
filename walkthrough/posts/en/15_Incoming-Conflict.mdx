| General Tips and Strategy |
| ![Checkmark](/images/walkthorough/302062a858042a1d.webp) ![Checkmark](/images/walkthorough/302062a858042a1d.webp) [Use Plant and Wind Attacks](#hs_1)[Watch Out for Changing Resistances](#hs_2) |

#### Use Plant and Wind Attacks

UltimateBrachiomon is a Data type weak to **Plant and Wind** attacks, so make sure your team has **Virus-type Digimon** with these elemental skills.

#### Watch Out for Changing Resistances

UltimateBrachiomon will **alternate between resistances to Physical and Magic attacks**. When this happens, use Digimon that will deal extra damage according to UltimateBrachiomon's current state.

#### Destroy Vulcanusmon's Mechanical Arms

Vulcanusmon's boss battle **has three phases** where you have to **destroy its mechanical arms** each time. Destroy them as quickly as possible to avoid taking the brunt of its damage dealt by its lethal moves.

#### Attack with Data-type Digimon

You might have to forgo using Vaccine Digimon to strike the balance between attacking Vulcanusmon and its mechanical arms, which are **mainly weak to Data-type Digimon**, including Vulcanusmon itself.

Note that the mechanical arms do not have any elemental weaknesses and resistances.
