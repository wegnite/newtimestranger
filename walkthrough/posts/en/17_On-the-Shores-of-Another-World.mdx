#### Defeat the Two Divermon First

Defeat the two Divermon first as they hinder you with Taunts and debuffs. After defeating them, you can focus on attacking Sharkmon all by itself.

#### Use an Offensive Cross Art

An offensive Cross Art like **Cross Art: Strike** or **Cross Art: Burst** is helpful in clearing the battle faster, especially when defeating the two Divermon first. It is also useful in attacking Sharkmon's Jasper when it begins charging All-Out Bombardment.

#### Take Advantage of Sharkmon's Weaknesses

Use **Vaccine-type Digimon** against Sharkmon, which is also weak to **Electricity, Null, and Ice**. Also take note of its Jasper taking increased damage from **Earth and Steel**.
