#### How to Convert Digimon

Leverage the Convert functionality within your **Digivice** to recruit additional partner Digimon. Successful conversion requires achieving a Scan Rate ranging from **100%** to **200%**, with superior rates conferring enhanced talent attributes and maximum HP values. Engaging in combat with Digimon **progressively increases** their Scan Rate. Prioritize targeting **Vaccine Type** Digimon to secure tactical advantages during the mission's concluding boss encounter.

#### How to Digivolve

Digivolve a Digimon through your **Digivice** by meeting the required **stats** and **Agent Rank**. You can also **De-Digivolve** to explore multiple evolution paths. We recommend evolving **Koromon** into **Agumon**, as Agumon's **Vaccine Type** provides a clear advantage for the upcoming boss.
