| 2 | ![MetalGreymon Battle](/images/walkthorough/37b5d3a69274fb56.webp) You will be attacked by MetalGreymon, but this time Omnimon comes to your aid. Work together with Omnimon to defeat MetalGreymon.▶︎ [How to Beat MetalGreymon (Blue)](#hm_201) |
| 3 | ![Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building Entrance](/images/walkthorough/2add523b2ad08e70.webp) Follow the marker to return to the surface. Once you reach the building entrance, you can use Convert to add a new Digimon to your party.▶︎ [How to Convert Digimon](#hs_1) |
| 4 | ![Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building Blocked Area](/images/walkthorough/48afca0d4630d42b.webp) Once inside the building, you can battle to level up your party while farming for Scan Rate. The area also contains several lootable items. If you encounter a blocked path near the marker, simply take the alternate route around the map to reach it. |
| 5 | ![Elevator to 36F North Tower.png](/images/walkthorough/8fa632d24583fcfc.webp) When you reach the marker, take the elevator up to arrive at the 36F North Tower. |
| 6 | ![Use Analyze Mode](/images/walkthorough/c5fd34ce1bac903e.webp) The 36F North Tower contains lootable items and several new Digimon you can farm for scans. Once you reach the marker, activate Analyze Mode to reveal a hidden wall, then use DigiAttack to destroy it. |
| 7 | ![Rescue Biyomon](/images/walkthorough/5250626afda0af78.webp) Follow the marker through the hallway until a cutscene plays. Afterward, backtrack and take the north hallway to find Biyomon. Explore the map and use Analyze Mode and DigiAttack to clear blocked paths. Once you rescue Biyomon, escort it back to the previous area so it can help you cross. |
| 8 | ![Digivolution](/images/walkthorough/51238dcc3b19ac50.webp) Biyomon will fail to carry you across and you will fall to the 24F South Wing. Follow the marker until you receive a notification that your Digimon can now Digivolve. Use this chance to level up in preparation for the upcoming boss fight. When you are ready, proceed to the marker to reach the roof.▶︎ [How to Digivolve](#hs_2) |
| 9 | ![Signs of an Anomaly Walkthrough Kuwagamon Battle.png](/images/walkthorough/55be2724347d1a12.webp) When you reach the roof, Kuwagamon will appear and charge at you, triggering the boss battle. Defeat Kuwagamon to complete the mission.▶︎ [How to Beat Kuwagamon](#hm_202) |

#### How to Convert Digimon

Use the Convert feature on your **Digivice** to add a new partner Digimon. A Scan Rate between **100%** and **200%** is required, with higher rates granting better talent and max HP. Defeating a Digimon in battle **increases** its Scan Rate. Focus on **Vaccine Type** Digimon for an advantage in the mission's final boss fight.

#### How to Digivolve

Digivolve a Digimon through your **Digivice** by meeting the required **stats** and **Agent Rank**. You can also **De-Digivolve** to explore multiple evolution paths. We recommend evolving **Koromon** into **Agumon**, as Agumon’s **Vaccine Type** provides a clear advantage for the upcoming boss.

Bring a Vaccine Type Digimon such as **Agumon** or **Gomamon** to gain a natural advantage. Vaccine Types deal **extra damage** to Kuwagamon, making the fight much easier.
