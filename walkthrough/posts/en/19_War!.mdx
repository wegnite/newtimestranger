#### Defeat Fugamon First

Like in your first battle with them, prioritize defeating Fugamon first as it has the **least number of HP** among the three. Then, target Hyogamon next and Ogremon last.

#### Use Digimon That Target All Weaknesses

### Boss

### Attribute Weakness

### Elemental Weakness
