### How to Beat Phase 1: Titamon + SkullBaluchimon

#### Use Fire and Light Attacks

Although Titamon + SkullBaluchim does not have any elemental weaknesses, it is still susceptible to **Fire and Light** attacks. Also keep in mind that the boss is weak to **Vaccine** Digimon.

#### Use Buffs and Debuffs

Because Titamon + SkullBaluchimon buffs its own attacks, you can counter this by **buffing your team's defense** or debuffing Titamon + SkullBaluchimon's own. You can also **buff your ATK or CRT** to guarantee more damaging attacks against the boss.

#### Bring Recovery Items

Titamon + SkullBaluchimon can easily overwhelm you with its aggression, so prepare some Recovery items in advance to heal and revive your Digimon when they take too many hits.

### How to Beat Phase 2: Titamon (Berserk)

#### Activate Mini EM Net Generator

Activate the **Mini EM Net Generator** in your inventory to permanently disable Titamon's time-stopping ability. The next time Titamon prepares its charged attack, you can interrupt it normally by depleting its charging bar.

#### Use Electricity Attacks on Twin Blades

After disabling Titamon's control of time, you will have to interrupt its next charged attack by destroying his **Twin Blades**. Exploit its weakness to **Electricity** to destroy it quickly and briefly incapacitate Titamon.

#### Heal or Revive Your Team

Titamon's attacks can deal widespread AoE damage that can wipe out your entire team if they are at low health. To curb this, heal your team from time to time and revive them with Revive Capsules when the situation calls for it.
