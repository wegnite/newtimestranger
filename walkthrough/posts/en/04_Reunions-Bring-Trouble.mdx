#### Weak Against Vaccine Type Digimon

### Recommended Digimon

- ![[Agumon](https://game8.co/games/Digimon-Story-Time-Stranger/archives/555161) Image](https://img.game8.co/4294384/594b563b0d06347e199b7ea6bac9b8b9.png/show) Agumon
- ![[Biyomon](https://game8.co/games/Digimon-Story-Time-Stranger/archives/555199) Image](https://img.game8.co/4294391/df23149f85981f5cbb8c65ff6264366a.png/show) Biyomon

- ![[Monodramon](https://game8.co/games/Digimon-Story-Time-Stranger/archives/555194) Image](https://img.game8.co/4295337/caa628383b32d78b0b9b554caffdf06a.png/show) Monodramon
- ![[Ryudamon](https://game8.co/games/Digimon-Story-Time-Stranger/archives/555181) Image](https://img.game8.co/4295343/b365e7e5962cae97fb599cad2bac4518.png/show) Ryudamon

Since Raremon is a Virus type, keeping **Vaccine** digimon on your team will allow you to deal stronger attacks while receiving less damage. Raremon is also weak to **Fire**, so **Agumon** and **Biyomon's** skills will be especially helpful in the battle.

Agumon can be digivolved from Koromon, while Biyomon can easily be converted as there are a lot of them in the underground waterway. Alternatively, you can use other early game Vaccine digivolutions like **Monodramon** and **Ryudamon**.

#### Use Cross Arts and Healing Items

Raremon has attacks that can poison your digimon, so it's important to keep watch on your digimon's HP and use Healing Items like **Poison Recovery** and **HP Capsules** in between turns to keep them alive.

Raremon's attacks can also inflict stat debuffs on your digimon, so you can boost their stats back up with **Cross Art: Field** to keep them strong enough for the battle.
