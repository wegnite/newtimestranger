#### Weak Against Vaccine Type Digimon

**Recommended Digimon:**

- **Agumon** - Strong Vaccine type with fire attacks
- **Biyomon** - Reliable Vaccine Digimon with fire skills
- **Monodramon** - Excellent early-game Vaccine choice
- **Ryudamon** - Powerful Vaccine Digimon option

Since Raremon is a Virus type, maintaining **Vaccine** Digimon on your team will enable you to deliver more powerful attacks while sustaining reduced damage. Raremon is also vulnerable to **Fire** attacks, so **Agumon** and **Biyomon's** abilities will be particularly effective in this battle.

Agumon can be digivolved from Koromon, while Biyomon can easily be converted as there are numerous specimens in the underground waterway. Alternatively, you can utilize other early-game Vaccine digivolutions like **Monodramon** and **Ryudamon**.

#### Use Cross Arts and Healing Items

Raremon possesses attacks that can poison your Digimon, so it's crucial to monitor your Digimon's HP and utilize Healing Items such as **Poison Recovery** and **HP Capsules** between turns to maintain their survival.

Raremon's attacks can also inflict stat debuffs on your Digimon, so you can restore their stats using **Cross Art: Field** to keep them sufficiently strong for the battle.
