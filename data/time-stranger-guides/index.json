Digivolution Planner and Calculator★ Best Digimon | Best Team | Best Starter☆ Best Agent Skills | Anomaly Points★ Best Personality | How to Change Personality☆ How Do Load Enhancements Work?★ Digifarm Guide | How to Raise Stats\n\nThis is a beginner's guide to Digimon Story: Time Stranger. Learn everything you need to know about the game including the basics of exploration, its combat mechanics, and every in-game system you'll need to know to navigate through the game.\n\nList of Contents\n\nAs a turn based battle system, the game's combat system focuses on issuing commands to your current Digimon and choosing targets for the move you choose to use based on your currently active Digimon.\n\nThe game's goal is to eliminate the enemy Digimon by depleting their HP to zero using offensive moves and skills.\n\nThese are all the commands you can use during the game's combat. It's highly recommended to speed up the game's speed during regular exploration to speed up your progression and not get bogged down by every move's animation.\n\nThe Auto feature is also recommended if you're exploring an area with weaker Digimon than your roster as you can easily heal up your party after battle.\n\nThe game's combat system is a turn-based system where every unit's turn will be based on the Digimon's SPD (Speed) stat. The higher your Digimon's SPD, the more often they'll be able to act again after a turn.\n\nAll Stat Effects and How to Raise Stats\n\nThere are 7 Attributes for a Digimon, including Data, Vaccine, Virus, Free, Unknown, Variable, and No Data. Virus is weak to Vaccine, which is weak to Data.\n\nNo Data, Free, Variable, and Unknown Digimon have no resistances and weaknesses toward other Attributes.",

    "summary": "Master scanning, combat, and evolution systems in Digimon Story: Time Stranger with pro tips that turn rookies into champion tamers fast.\n\nDigimon Story: Time Stranger\n\nBy Mostafa Salem\n\nUpdated Oct 6, 2025\n\nUpdated Oct 6, 2025\n\nStepping into the digital world of Digimon Story: Time Stranger can feel overwhelming when you're juggling scan percentages, attribute matchups, and a growing roster of partners. But here's the thing - once you understand the core systems that separate this game from typical monster collectors, you'll be raising championship-level teams faster than you can say \"Digivolve!\" Whether you're a franchise veteran or completely new to digital monsters, these essential strategies will transform you from a confused rookie into a confident tamer.\n\nMost players make a critical mistake within their first hour: converting Digimon the moment they hit 100% scan data. This feels natural - you've unlocked a new partner, so why wait? Because patience here literally doubles your Digimon's potential through a hidden stat called ABI (Ability).\n\nWhen you scan wild Digimon beyond 100%, you're building toward a 200% threshold that dramatically increases your converted partner's starting ABI. This hidden stat determines how many bonus points your Digimon can earn through training and evolution cycles. A partner converted at 100% scan might struggle to reach decent stats even with perfect care, while the same species converted at 200% becomes a powerhouse capable of handling endgame content.\n\nDIGIMON STORY TIME STRANGER – The Game ...\n\nThe difference isn't subtle. You're looking at roughly 50% higher stat potential for waiting those extra battles. Smart tamers keep mental notes of which species they want for their core team and deliberately grind those targets to 200% before converting.\n\nYour starter and early captures won't follow this rule since you need bodies to progress, but any long-term team member should absolutely wait for maximum scan data.\n\nYour scan function does more than just collect Digimon data - it's your treasure detector and secret path revealer rolled into one tool. Press Scan regularly while exploring to uncover hidden items that remain completely invisible otherwise. We're talking major healing supplies, evolution materials, and equipment pieces hiding in plain sight.",
