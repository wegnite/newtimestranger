# Starting the game - Digimon Story Time Stranger Walkthrough & Guide - GameFAQs

Version: 0.75h | Updated: 10/13/2025

Before you start you will be asked to choose the difficulty of the game, the 2 hardest modes Mega and Mega+ are unavailable on a first run of the game.

For now here are the difficulties available to you:

For the sake of this guide on a first run I will be going with Hard.

You will then be made to choose between the 2 protagonists. The boy Dan Yuki, or the girl Kanon Yuki. They are not the same person and which ever you dont choose will play a supporting role during the story, it won't diverge the story however.

You can also change their names.

You can also change the character and the name at any time you want.

The game will then proceed through some scenes.

Note: For those who want to play in japanese your gonna have to wait a bit to change the language unfortunately.

In any case sit back and watch the scenes as Mirei Mikagura (a returning character from prior story games, also she is younger for some reason this time.)
