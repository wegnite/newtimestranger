This is a beginner's guide to Digimon Story: Time Stranger. Learn everything you need to know about the game including the basics of exploration, its combat mechanics, and every in-game system you'll need to know to navigate through the game.

List of Contents

As a turn based battle system, the game's combat system focuses on issuing commands to your current Digimon and choosing targets for the move you choose to use based on your currently active Digimon.

The game's goal is to eliminate the enemy Digimon by depleting their HP to zero using offensive moves and skills.

These are all the commands you can use during the game's combat. It's highly recommended to speed up the game's speed during regular exploration to speed up your progression and not get bogged down by every move's animation.

The Auto feature is also recommended if you're exploring an area with weaker Digimon than your roster as you can easily heal up your party after battle.

The game's combat system is a turn-based system where every unit's turn will be based on the Digimon's SPD (Speed) stat. The higher your Digimon's SPD, the more often they'll be able to act again after a turn.

All Stat Effects and How to Raise Stats

There are 7 Attributes for a Digimon, including Data, Vaccine, Virus, Free, Unknown, Variable, and No Data. Virus is weak to Vaccine, which is weak to Data.

No Data, Free, Variable, and Unknown Digimon have no resistances and weaknesses toward other Attributes.
