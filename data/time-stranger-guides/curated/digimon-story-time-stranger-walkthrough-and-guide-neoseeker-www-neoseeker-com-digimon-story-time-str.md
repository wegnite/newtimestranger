Time Stranger incorporates many staple elements of the monster-collecting genre, although with its own fresh spin on established features, with examples such as Digievolution and Personalities ensuring that the series remains distinct from other established franchises. This allows for a wide variety of approaches on how to assemble your own Digimon party and tackle its many challenges, something that shouldn't be a problem with the help of our guide!

- A series of separate guides covering its Side Missions, which are unlocked gradually as you advance through the game and provide with useful rewards.
