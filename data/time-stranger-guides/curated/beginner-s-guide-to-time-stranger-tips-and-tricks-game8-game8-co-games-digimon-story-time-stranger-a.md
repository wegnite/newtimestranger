### Beginner's Guide to Digimon Story Time Stranger



#### Learn the Combat System

As a turn based battle system, the game's combat system focuses on issuing commands to your current Digimon and choosing targets for the move you choose to use based on your currently active Digimon.

The game's goal is to eliminate the enemy Digimon by depleting their HP to zero using offensive moves and skills.

##### Commands Guide

These are all the commands you can use during the game's combat. It's highly recommended to speed up the game's speed during regular exploration to speed up your progression and not get bogged down by every move's animation.

The Auto feature is also recommended if you're exploring an area with weaker Digimon than your roster as you can easily heal up your party after battle.

##### SPD (Speed) Affects Turn Order

The game's combat system is a turn-based system where every unit's turn will be based on the Digimon's SPD (Speed) stat. The higher your Digimon's SPD, the more often they'll be able to act again after a turn.

All Stat Effects and How to Raise Stats

#### Learn the Different Attributes and Element Types

There are 7 Attributes for a Digimon, including Data, Vaccine, Virus, Free, Unknown, Variable, and No Data. Virus is weak to Vaccine, which is weak to Data.

No Data, Free, Variable, and Unknown Digimon have no resistances and weaknesses toward other Attributes.

Attributes and Elements Compatibility Guide

#### Analyze the Environment to Find Hidden and Breakable Objects

While you do not have much control options during exploration, be sure to always use the Analyze function while exploring. This will let you reveal hidden items and materials for the taking, as well as objects you can potentially destroy to reveal new paths.

#### Convert Scanned Digimon to 200%

When you defeat an enemy Digimon in a fight, they will be added to the Convert screen where you can see a scan meter for each defeated Digimon. The scan rate increases each time you defeat a Digimon and reaching 100% allows you to obtain and add them to your party.

Make sure to scan a Digimon at 200% if you want to use them in your party. Those with high Scan Rate have higher Talent and max HP, which are beneficial for raising a Digimon.

#### Use Load Enhancements and Training to Make Strong Digimon

Use the Load Enhancements feature to quickly level up your Digimon by feeding it with your other Material Digimon. Doing so gives them bonus stats, increased Talent, EXP, and Attachment Skills.

To increase a Digimon's specific stat, use the Training Sets from the Digifarm. One training session takes 30 minutes in real-time to complete, so you can leave your Digimon on the farm to raise its stats as you progress through the main story.

How Do Load Enhancements Work?

#### Choose Your Agent Skills Carefully

Make sure to read the descriptions of each Agent Skill before spending your Anomaly Points on it, as there is no option to respec them once you have unlocked them.

A recommended option is to choose Agent Skills from the Bonds of Loyalty category. These let you learn new Cross Arts, increase your CP Gauge, and gain more EXP in battle.

Best Agent Skills

#### Increase Your Digimon's Bond Percentage

A Digimon with a high Bond percentage is able to inherit is cumulative stats when it Digivolves or De-Digivolves, allowing it to boost its stats up to 100 times max.

You can increase the Bond percentage by having the Digimon participate in battles, talking to them the option comes up, and feeding them food when placed at the Digifarm.

How to Increase Digimon Bond

#### Complete Side Missions Whenever Possible

You will start obtaining the first set of side missions during A Vow Made on Starry Sky and The In-Between main missions. Take the time to complete these to earn money, Anomaly Points, as well as items and Attachment Skills.
