### Best Ways to Farm EXP Fast

- Use Load Enhancements
- Hunt for Tyrannomon Early in the Game
- Lower the Game Difficulty
- Complete The Hall of EXP Outer Dungeon

#### Use Load Enhancements

The Load Enhancements feature allows you to level up a selected Digimon by feeding it with weaker Material Digimon in your Reserve.

##### Level Up Converted Digimon for Max Value

One way to use Load Enhancements is to convert an available Digimon and then feed it to your Base Digimon. Look for a Digimon that is at least 1 generation higher than your Base Digimon. Afterwards, farm for the higher generation Digimon up to 100% conversion, then load this to the Base Digimon that you want to level up.

It is best to level up a Converted Digimon first before you load them. A stronger Converted Digimon will provide more stats to your Base Digimon, along with extra talent levels.

##### Set Your Digimon to Protect to Avoid Accidental Loading

Make sure to do this process carefully so you do not accidentally feed a Party Member Digimon onto another. You can set your Digimon to Protect by going to the Setup and then pressing on Equipment/Skills. This will make the Digimon ineligible for Load Enhancement.

How Do Load Enhancements Work?

#### Hunt for Tyrannomon Early in the Game

While in the earlier stages of the game, hunt for Tyrannomon to boost your Digimons' levels. Tyrannomon will begin to spawn in the game between The In-Between and the Gathering Storm Clouds main missions. As a Digimon with high Digivolution, as well as a Champion generation, Tyrannomon will become a good source of EXP in your early game levels.

##### Include Minervamon in the Party During the Battle

Minervamon will be an asset to your party due to her powerful attacks against Tyrannomon. She will be accompanying you as you progress through the main missions.

All Main Missions and Walkthrough

#### Lower the Game Difficulty

Lower the game's difficulty to Story to farm EXP faster, as you will have an easier time defeating enemy Digimons. You can set this up in the Options via the Systems menu.

Do note that this will not change the amount of EXP or items that you will obtain from battles.

#### Complete The Hall of EXP DLC Outer Dungeon

The most reliable way of getting EXP fast is to complete The Hall of EXP Outer Dungeon.

This dungeon allows you to fight enemy Digimon to get as much EXP as you can. This is also helpful if you need to level up your Digimon when playing the game on Hard, Mega, and Mega+ difficulty modes.

You can access the Outer Dungeons when you speak with Mirei Mikagura at The In-Between Theater.

##### Can Only Be Accessed Via DLC Purchase

Note that you need to buy the separate Outer Dungeons DLC to access this feature. These are not included in the Standard, Deluxe, and Ultimate Editions of the game.

### How to Get EXP



#### Defeat Enemy Digimon

You can get EXP when you defeat enemy Digimon in random encounters. This method takes time as you need to wait for enemies to respawn on the field.

Exiting and re-entering a map may also cause the enemies to randomly respawn. Be on a look out for Enemy Digimons who are stronger than you as defeating them can drop more EXP points for your party. You can use the DigiAttack to avoid time consuming battles.

#### Use the DigiFarm

Using the DigiFarm is one way to earn EXP but with extra stats, depending on the type of Training Set that you will use. Place your Digimons in the DigiFarm and wait for 30 minutes in real-world time until your Digimon has finished their training.

Speeding this up is possible by expending yen through the Quick Complete Training selection. The DigiFarm becomes accessible once the In-Between Theater is available.
