### Best DLC to Buy



#### Best DLC Overview



#### Outer Dungeon DLC is the Best DLC to Buy

The recommended DLC to buy is the paid Outer Dungeons. This unlocks three dungeons that allow you to farm EXP, money, and materials quickly.

Note that this DLC is not included in the Standard, Deluxe, and Ultimate Editions of the game. You must purchase it as a separate DLC.

All Outer Dungeon Locations

#### Accessory USBs Can Help with Farming EXP and Money

The accessories included in the Public Safety Suit & Special Supplies Set can help you with gaining EXP, money, and items quickly.

Combine this with the paid Outer Dungeons DLC to progress the game more efficiently and can help with training Digimon in Mega+ difficulty.

#### Season Pass Offers New Digimon

Purchasing the Season Pass DLC gives you additional DLC-exclusive Digimon once they are released at a later date in 2026. Only the Golden Moai Farm Item is available in the game.

Here are the release dates for each content as shown in the Steam Store page:

- Additional Digimon & Episode Pack 1 - January - March 2026
- Additional Digimon & Episode Pack 2 - January - March 2026
- Additional Digimon & Episode Pack 3 - April - June 2026

### How to Check Purchased DLC



#### Go to the Title Screen to Check

When you purchase DLC for the game, start the game and a pop up window should appear confirming that the DLCs are now available.

Note that if you purchase a DLC while playing, it will not appear automatically. Save your game and close it first so it will appear.
