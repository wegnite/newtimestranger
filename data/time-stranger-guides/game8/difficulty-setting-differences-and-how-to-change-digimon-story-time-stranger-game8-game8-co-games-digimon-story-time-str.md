### Difficulty Setting Differences



#### All Difficulties and Their Features



#### Story Mode Reduces Enemy Damage

Story Mode reduces enemy damage and is recommended for those looking to experience the game's story. This difficulty mode also allows players to retry battles in Invincibility Mode.

#### Balanced Mode Uses Standard Settings

Balanced Mode uses the game's default settings and is recommended for those who want a fair fight in combat situations. Players can also retry battles at a reduced difficulty if defeated twice.

#### Hard Mode Increases Enemy Damage

Hard Mode is recommended for more experienced players who are looking to test their skills when it comes to turn-based combat and party composition. This difficulty mode requires players to note down their Digimon's Attribute and Elemental affinities further as damage dealt by enemies is stronger.

#### Mega Difficulty Increases Enemy Damage and Appearance on the Field

Mega Difficulty takes hard mode further by making enemy Digimon stronger and appear in greater numbers when on the field. Optimal party composition and training are required when tackling the game on this mode.

#### Mega+ Difficulty Disables Item Use and Escape Command

Mega+ Difficulty disables the ability to flee from battles and you also cannot use items in battle. This requires you to create team compositions and use Personality skills that allow you to recover HP.

### How to Change Difficulty



#### Change Difficulty in the Settings Menu

When starting a new game, you have the option to choose the game's difficulty. You can also change this setting at any time when you pause the game or from the main menu by heading to the Options menu.

### Difficulty Trophies



#### The Pinnacle of Existence

The game has one difficulty trophy to obtain and it requires you to complete the game on Mega+ difficulty, the highest difficulty mode.
