### What are Load Enhancements



#### Used to Load Weaker Digimon to Strengthen Another

The Load Enhancement feature is used to feed weaker Material Digimon in your Reserve to power-up a specific Digimon. This will give you bonus stats, Talent, EXP, and their Attachment Skills.

##### Make Sure to Lock Any Digimon You Don't Want to Load

Be careful with foddering Digimon when using Load Enhancement. Press R3 or the P Key on your Keyboard at the Details Screen so you don't accidentally feed a Party Member onto your Digimon.

### Benefits to Loading Digimon



#### Preferred Over Digivolving and De-Digivolving Multiple Times

Unlike Cyber Sleuth and Hacker's Memory, Time Stranger prefers you to plan out what you want your Digimon to Evolve into.

This is because of the Bond Stat which limits how much every stat can carry over when Digivolving. However, by Loading Digimon, you can bypass that and add stats onto a Digimon via loading.

How to Increase Digimon Bond

#### Used to Inherit Cumulative Stats from Other Digimon

By feeding Digimon with increased Cumulative Stats (the Blue Stats beside your Main Stats), you can increase the stats of the Digimon you fed it to based on what the sacrificed Digimon had.

##### Cumulative Stats Formula

For example, if you feed a Veemon with 381 in its Defense, you can expect to get 10 Blue stats on the Digimon you Loaded it into. This applies to each stat respectively.

If you Digivolve the Digimon you fed it into, it will carry over the Blue Cumulative Stats.

#### Used for EXP and Increase Your Digimon's Talent Stat

By loading weaker Digimon into another, you can increase their stats and Level without the need to fight. This can be used to get Talent Points and EXP without the need to grind, but not Bond.

#### Pass on Attachment Skills From Loaded Digimon

A new feature in Time Stranger, you can Load Digimon to other Digimon to pass on their Attatchment Skills onto your Main Digimon.

Note that any Attatchment Skills equipped by the Fodder will be equipped to the Loaded Digimon, and all unequipped Attachment Skills will also be transferred.

### How to Get More From Load Enhancements



#### Load Converted Digimon With High Scan Rates

Digimon with higher Scan Rates will automatically have an increased Talent Stat. This is good to fodder to get more Talent onto a Digimon without Digivolving or De-Digivolving.

#### Load Higher Rank and Level Digimon

You get more EXP and Talent if you Load Digimon that have higher Level and Ranks. Try to level and evolve fodder Digimon for a more efficient grind

### Comment

Basically I feel like you're missing some information here.

Can you clarify "For example, if you feed a Veemon with 381 in its Defense, you can expect to get 10 Blue stats on the Digimon you Loaded it into."? Do you mean a veemon with 381 in blue stats, or regular stats? Because based on your formula, if I for example load that veemon into a lv 1 digimon with no blue stats and who is just at its base stats, if the veemon has 381 blue stats it should gain 190.5 blue stats. If that veemon's 381 is in its white stats, it should gain nothing.
