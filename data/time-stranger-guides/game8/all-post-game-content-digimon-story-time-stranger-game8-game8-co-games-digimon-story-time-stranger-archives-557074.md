#### New Game Plus

Completing the main story of the game unlocks New Game Plus. This is a feature that lets you play the game from the start but carries over your Digimon and Agent stats.

New Game Plus Unlocks

##### Unlocks Mega and Mega+ Difficulty

When you start the game in New Game Plus, you can choose two new difficulty modes: Mega and Mega+.

These are difficulty modes that require optimal training and party composition as enemy Digimon deal more damage and appear more in the field. In addition, the Mega+ difficulty disables the ability to escape and use items in battle.

Note that these two difficulty modes are only available in New Game Plus.
