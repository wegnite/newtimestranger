### How to Make Your Digimon Stronger



#### Increase Its Level

By increasing a Digimon's Level, you can obtain more stats to deal and tank more damage. Additionally, if you recently Digivolved a Digimon with a high Bond %, it will also gain more Cumulative Stats (the Blue Stats) via Level-up!

##### Increase Its Talent

A digimon's level is capped by its Talent Stat. You can increase this by participating in battles, Digivolving, Load Enhancements, and Training at the DigiFarm.

How to Increase Level Cap and Talent Level

#### Max Out Its Stats

You can increase your stats with Augment Chips, Levelling-up, or via Load Enhancements. The more you can get your stats up, the more Digivolution branches you can unlock for certain Digimon on top of stats.

##### Increase Your Stats via Load Enhancements

You can also gain Cumulative Stats from Load Enhancements by loading in Digimon who already have Levels and Cumulative Stats.

By feeding Digimon with increased Stats, you can increase the Cumulative stats of the Digimon you fed it to based on what the sacrificed Digimon had.

How Do Load Enhancements Work?

##### Increase Its Stats and Bond via DigiFarm

The DigiFarm is mandatory if you want to max out your Digimon's Stats and Bond. Bond determines how much of your stats carry over when Digivolving and the Stats you gained by training at the Farm won't mean much if they don't carry over after Digivolution.

Digifarm Guide

#### Digivolve It to Its Highest Form

Just like any other monster collecting game, evolving your monsters into higher ranked forms will see a notable increase in their stats. Do note that different stages are locked behind your Agent Rank.

How to Increase Agent Rank

##### Learn When to De-Digivolve

While raising your monsters, you'll notice you will lack stats to further Digivolve into certain branches. To remedy this, you need to Dedigivolve and head to other branches for more Cumulative Stats. Digivolution Guide and All Evolution Lines

#### Obtain Attachment Skills from Different Branches

Listed above are the Level cutoffs for when each Digimon Stage stops learning new Attachment Skills. You can obtain different Attachment Skills from every Digimon at certain levels.

By branching out to other Digivolutions, this will also give you a wider variety in Support Skills and Elemental Coverage.

##### You Can Also Move Skills from Other Digimon

Attachment Skills can be equipped and unequipped by any Digimon at any time. If your Physical Attacking Digimon learns a Magic Skill, feel free to not learn it and put in on your Magic Attacking Digimon instead.

#### Match Its Personality With Its Intended Role

Personality influences the Digimon's Stats as they level up, as well as what Skill they have. Make sure to talk to your Digimon to influence their personality to suit your role in your team.

Best Personality Type and Skills

##### Know Your Digimon's Stats and Attacking Moves

Knowing what Signature Skills your Digimon have and their Base Stats can give your a general idea on what role they should fulfill.

If their current personality is a poor match, or you want them to have a different Personality Skill, use Training Items in the DigiFarm to change it.

How to Change Personality

#### Obtain More Agent Skills

Outside of bonus EXP and Cross Arts, Agent Skills also buff certain Digimon depending on their Personality. Make sure to unlock these nodes as you complete Missions for a free boost in your Digimon's stats.

### What Makes a Digimon Strong?



#### Any Digimon Now Has the Potential To Be Strong

With the DigiFarm and Load Enhancements, any Digimon can easily max out their stats. Do note that lower Level Digimon have terrible Signature attacks compared to their Mega counterparts.

#### Signature Abilities Removed

With the removal of Abilities, Digimon like UlforceVeedramon and PlatinumNumemon have fallen out of favor. These have been replaced with Personality Skills which are more balanced and obtainable by any Digimon.

Best Personality Skills

#### Most Digimon Now Rely on Their Signature Attacks

Some Digimon, namely Mega Levels, now have updated Signature Attacks that have additional effects like decreasing DEF, SPI, and Elemental Resistance. Do try to slot in Support Digimon like these since they're preferred over Digimon that just do damage.

##### No More Moves With Piercing Damage

Piercing effects from some moves have been removed from Time Stranger. These were moves that ignored the opponent's defensive stats, regardless of any buffs.
