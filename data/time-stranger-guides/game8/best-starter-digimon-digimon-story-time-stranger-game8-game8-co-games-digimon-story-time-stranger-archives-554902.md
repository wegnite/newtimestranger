### Best Starter Digimon to Choose



#### Patamon is the Best Starter for Long-Term Investment

Patamon is a Data Digimon making it a bit difficult for early game, but you can just pick up a lot of good of Vaccine Digimon to supplement this weakness.

It has access to mostly Vaccine and Data Magic Attackers when digivolved, and can also evolve to a lot of Digimon that learn Heal Skills with good SPI stats, so you can transition it to a Healer and Buffer as needed.

#### DemiDevimon is Decent, But Easy to Get Early

DemiDevimon is a Virus Digimon whose line mostly learns Dark Type Attacks. It has access to amazing Digivolution lines, but you can easily get a 200% Scan Rate with the nearby Pagumon, letting you have access to it or Impmon easily.

#### Gomamon is Strong Early, But Quickly Falls Off

Gomamon is a Vaccine Digimon, and while it does make it good against the first few bosses, by the time you reach other bosses you can get better Vaccines as you progress. Especially since you get the Icicle Edge I Attachment Skill early on.

Out of the three though, it does have easy access to the most Olympos XII Digimon, notably Neptunemon, Venusmon, and Dianamon.

#### Which Starter Would You Choose?

Let us know why in the comments!

### Best Digivolution Lines for Each Starter Digimon



#### Patamon



##### Angemon Line

The classic line for Patamon, this line focuses on attacking with Magic Light type attacks. We also recommend going through Unimon to Tapirmon to get to Kyubimon so you can also get the Spell Boost skill.

##### Ceresmon Line

One of the easiest Olympos XII line to get for Patamon, this line focuses on healing and providing buffs for allies.

We recommend going down to Tokomon to get up to Firamon for Attack Field and Acceleration Boost, or Unimon to Taomon to get Spell Boost and Magic Field for buffing your damage dealers.

##### Lucemon Line

This one requires a good amount of investment since you need Tokomon at a super high amount of INT to get to Lucemon, but it is worth getting as Lucemon SM has always been a reliable Dark Virus damage dealer.

You can head to this path even after going through the Angemon Line, so pick up Mental Break from Shakkoumon for even more damage!

#### DemiDevimon



##### Devimon Line

The classic line for DemiDevimon, this line focuses on attacking with Magic Dark type attacks. We also recommend getting Mental Break and Spell Boost from LadyDevimon.

##### Plutomon Line

One of the easiest Olympos XII line to get for DemiDevimon, this line focuses instead on attacking with Physical Dark type attacks

We recommend going to Infermon to get Critical Charge, but most of the buff Skills you need will automatically be learned down the line like Guard Break and Acceleration Boost.

##### LadyDevimon Line

A strong Vaccine damage dealer, Mastemon is your go-to when facing both Dark and Light Type Virus Digimon!

The LadyDevimon Line already learns a lot of the buff skills you need like Mental Break and Spell Boost, but from Devimon you can go down to Impmon to nab Magic Field from Wizardmon.

#### Gomamon



##### Vikemon Line

The classic line for Gomamon, this line focuses on attacking with Physical Ice and Steel type attacks. However, it is pretty difficult to get the right Skills to make yourself a potent damage dealer.

For example, the easiest way to get Guard Break is from ChaosGallantmon, so you might as well stick with ChaosGallantmon instead.

##### Neptunemon Line

This one just skips going through Gomamon's evolution line and instead working your way up to Neptunemon from Crabmon instead. It is easier to go in and out of different branches to get the necessary skills like Acceleration Boost and Attack Field.

##### Dianamon Line

This build is an Ice Magic Attacker and is pretty easy to build. You can also go from IceDevimon to LadyDevimon and get a ton of amazing skills like Magic Charge, Mental Break, and Spell Boost.

### Best Personalities for Each Starter Digimon



#### Recommended Personalities for Each Starter

Depending on your build, you need to focus on raising your attacking stat for attackers. Or focus on SPI, DEF, and HP if you want to focus on support.

For example, Patamon and DemiDevimon both have Digivolution lines that focus in on Magic Damage, so try to get Wisdom or Philantrophy. On the flip side, Physical attackers should prefer Valor or Amicability.

If you bought the ultimate version of the game Demidevimon fits perfect with Agumon and Gabumon which are Vaccine and Data.
