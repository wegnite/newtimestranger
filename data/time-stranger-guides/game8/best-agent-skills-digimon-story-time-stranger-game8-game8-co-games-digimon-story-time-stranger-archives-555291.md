### Best Agent Skills to Unlock First



#### Prioritize the Bonds of Loyalty Skills First

Make sure to get the Bonds of Loyalty first, as the effects of these can have buffs for all of your Digimon and have Cross Arts which have amazing in-combat effects.

##### Get the EXP and Stat Boost Agent Skills per Agent Rank First

Prioritize getting the Education and Body Boost Agent Skills first as these give the most value. Do note that you can allocate Anomaly Points on other skills if you have not reached the proper Agent Rank for the higher rank Digimon.

If you have the Outer Dungeon DLCs, the value of EXP Agent Skills does diminish, so feel free to get the Cross Arts you need first.

##### Get the Cross-Arts and Boosts After

Cross-Arts are great, but don't really change the game until much later. Try to get Cross Art: Break and Cross Art: Aura first, then depending what your team shapes up to be and playstyle, unlock the others as you see fit.Best Cross Arts

##### Ignore the In-Training Education and Body Boost Agent Skills

Dont waste Anomaly Points on the In-Training Education and Body Boost Agent Skills, you already have access to Rookie Digimon at the start, so just level those up instead.

##### Cross Art: High Field

Cross Art: High Field can only be unlocked if you have all three Boost Skills connected to it. It is also worth 100 Anomaly Points, so you need to wait until end-game to get this.

#### Best Valor Agent Skills Priority

The Valor tree is focused on Digimon that have specialties in offensive capabilities. This tree aims to provide the best value per each skill you can take from the Valor skill tree to maximize your Anomaly point for your Digimon with the Valor personalities.

#### Best Wisdom Agent Skills Priority

The Wisdom tree is also an offensive tree but focusing on int and magic-focused digimon. This tree focuses on amplifying the said traits as well as piercing elements against enemy digimon's SPI.

#### Best Philantrophy Agent Skills Priority

This is a tree focused for healer digimon and amplifying their SPI and healing abilities.

#### Best Amicability Agent Skills Priority

Aims to amplify the speed and ability to gain the prerequisite abilities for your support digimon. More turns means it will be faster to apply buffs and debuffs and stack them on yours and enemy digimon alike!
