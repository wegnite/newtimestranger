### Best Team



#### Best Team for Early-Game

Patamon, Coronamon, Dracmon make up the best team for the early game of Digimon Story: Time Stranger. This team will also give you opportunities to use more popular Digimon like Seraphimon, Beelzemon, and Apollomon.

Do note that if you chose Agumon instead of Coronamon, we recommend getting Lunamon instead of Gabumon and building their DNA Digivolution partners up in the DigiFarm instead.

#### Best Team for Mid-Game



##### After Agent Rank 3

After Agent Rank 3, you can unlock Digivolution from Rookie to Champion. Try to keep a balance of having three for each attribute and have two different types of attackers, Magic and Physical Based.

Try to keep Cross Art: Aura as you won't have access to Party Wide Healing unless you get a Halsemon to Level 40. If there's any Attribute you can replace, the Vaccine Attributes will face some difficulty against bosses at this stage.

##### After Agent Rank 5

After Agent Rank 5, you can now unlock Digivolution from Champion to Ultimate. At this point, you should have access to more SPI and DEF reducing Signature Attacks.

You can now use other Cross Arts like Cross Art: Field or Cross Art: Break. If there's any Attribute you can swap out, Data Attributes will face some difficulty against the multitude of Virus bosses at this stage.

#### Best Team for End-Game

After Agent Rank 7, you can now unlock Digivolution from Ultimate to Mega. Try to find Digimon with amazing Synergy together like the Dianamon Magic Team listed above.

If you find youself a bit weak and your team is dying while grinding you can equip Cross Arts: Revive, otherwise use Cross Art: Field or Cross Art: Break. You should have total Attribute coverage by now, since you'll be facing different Attributes at the last stretch of the game.

#### Best Team for Post-Game / NG+

By Post-Game you should be at the final Agent Rank and have everything you need to create the strongest Digimon! You can now do the Post-Game Outer Dungeons, or start a New Game Plus!

You now have access to Chronomon HM, Chronomon DM, and Jupitermon, so play around with your teams to see which one suits your playstyle.

### How to Make a Good Team Comp



#### Complete the Attribute Triangle

More than anything, having a team that can cover different Digimon Attributes is very important and ensure you'll always have coverage. You have a party slot of six, so make sure to bring two of each.

For example, if you choose the Data Patamon as your starter, it would be wise to get a Virus Impmon and a Vaccine Agumon to fill out your team.

Attributes and Elements Compatibility Guide

#### Have Move Type Coverage

Make sure your Digimon have moves that can cover different Types. You Digimon will have Skills that match its affinity, so try to get Skills that deviate from their Signature.

Additionally, do try to match your Digimon's attacks with their highest attacking stat, be it Magic for INT or Physical for ATK.

#### Obtain Buffers and Debuffers

Certain Attachment Skills can inflict debuffs and give you party-wide buffs. Don't just focus on attacking with type advantages as these could considerably speed up or even complete certain fights due to their difficulty.

##### Some Digimon Have Buffs and Debuffs Combined to a Signature Attcking Skill

Certain Digimon have Signature Skills that can infllct debuffs, provide buffs, or inflict Status Conditions on top of dealing damage! These Digimon are considerably better to slot in as they can consolidate multiple roles while also dealing damage.

##### You Can Extend Buffs By Using Another Buff

If you notice a buff or debuff is about to run out, you can extend the duration of this by using another. Any buff or debuff can be extended even if it is not from the same Attack as long as it matches.

#### Healer Digimon Are Needed for Higher Difficulty

Healer Digimon with the Overprotective Personality can have the Great Embrace Skill. This Skill will overheal you beyond your Base HP which is important for Mega+ Difficulty and even just the ZombiePlutomon Boss Fight.

Best Personality Type and Skills

#### Know When to Digivolve

Try to know when to Digivolve and De-Digivolve your Members to get the most amount of Cumulative stats. As a rule of thumb, stay until Level 45 even if you already got the Skill you want.

Bond Points will limit how much Cumulative Stats you will get everytime you Digivolve and De-Digivolve, so might as well stay in that form for a bit for more Skills and Stats.

Digivolution Guide

##### If You Plan to Use a DNA Digivolution, Build The Partner Up in the Farm Instead

If you're planning to use Digimon like Omnimon and Imperialdramon, we recommend just building one half in your party, and the other in the DigiFarm.

This is because you will be left with an empty team slot if you do decide to DNA Digivolve, forcing you to build another member up.

Digifarm Guide

#### Build Around Your Favorites

Most important, have fun and pick the ones you want to use in your party. You don't have to stop by a DigiLab to swap party members around anyways, so feel free to experiment.

Any Digimon can have maxed out stats, and grinding is only made easier because of the Load Enhancements and DLC Outer Dungeons.
