### List of Best Early-Game Digimon



#### Best Early Vaccine Digimon

Vaccine digimon are the best to carry around at the early-game due to most of the bosses being Virus Digimon. An honorable mention would be Tentomon since you need an Electric Digimon for a few quests.

List of All Vaccine Digimon

#### Best Early Virus Digimon

Make sure to get a few Virus Digimon to make it easier to mow through the endless Data Digimon that will be wandering around as regular encounters.

List of All Virus Digimon

#### Best Early Data Digimon

Data Attribute Digimon are fine to have around, but do limit yourself to only getting one or two. You will struggle if you have too many in your party as a lot of Bosses will be Virus Attribute in the beginning.

List of All Data Digimon

#### Free and Unknown Digimon

Free and Unknown aren't that good at this point in the game due to their lack of Attribute effectiveness. They shine better when you can get them to Armor and DNA Digivolutions down the line.

The Keramon line does give you access to a Dark Type attacker, but that role can easily be covered by a lot of Virus Attribute Digimon like DemiDevimon or Dracmon.List of All Free Digimon
