### Digivolution Guide



#### Digivolution Transforms Digimon Into Stronger Forms

Digivolution refers to the process where a Digimon transforms into a stronger form.

During this process, they will also increase their Talent (level limit) and 10% of their previous stat value will be added to the cumulative stats (blue number in parenthesis in the Digimon's stats).

Digivolving a Digimon requires certain conditions and usually boils down to the following:

- Meet the required stats (excluding stat increases from equipment)
- Meet the required Agent Rank.

You can check the specific unlock condition to Digivolve a particular Digimon on the Digivolution screen.

#### De-Digivolution Reverts a Digimon to Its Previous Form

De-Digivolution is the reverse process, allowing you to revert a Digimon back to its previous form.

De-Digivolving does not decrease a Digimon's Talent, cumulative stats, and Bond.

De-Digivolving requires the following one of the two conditions:

- The resulting De-Digivolution Digimon is already registered in the Field Guide.
- The resulting De-Digivolution is of the same Personality.

### Benefits of Digivolving and De-Digivolving



#### Digivolving Gives Access to Higher Base Stats and New Attachment Skills

Digivolving is usually recommended when it is available as this allows your Digimon access to higher base stats, better Special Skills, and obtain new Attachment Skills. The latter can be removed from your Digimon to equip them to others.

#### De-Digivolving Lets You to Unlock a New Digimon of a Lower Form

De-Digivolving allows you to unlock a new lower form of the Digimon provided that it has the same Personality as your current Digimon.

In addition, it also lets you unlock other Digimon without having to convert a new one from a scanned Digimon.

For example, you can De-Digivolve Agumon into Koromon and increase its ATK and SPD stats so it can Digivolve into Dracomon. This newly Digivolved Dracomon will inherit the cumulative stats, Bond, and Talent from its previous forms.
