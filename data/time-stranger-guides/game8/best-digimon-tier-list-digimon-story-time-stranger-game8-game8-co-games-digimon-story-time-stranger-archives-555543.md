### Best Digimon Tier List



#### Best Mega and Mega+ Digimon Tier List



#### Tier List Criteria



##### Signature Skills with Extra Effects are Valued Heavily

Digimon with Signature Attacks that can Deal Damage on top of giving buffs, debuffs, Status Ailments, or healing are the qualities we look for when placing these Digimon in their Respective Tiers.

##### Team Synergy and Flexibility is Considered

Digimon that can work with multiple team compositions are placed higher on the list. Naturally, Supports and Healers will be more prevalent as these Digimon are needed for higher difficulties.

##### Stats and Damage are Not as Valued

Due to the availability of Load Enhancements and the DLC Outer Dungeons, even an In-Training Digimon will be able to clear the game.

But you can only do so much with buffing, Cross Arts, and healing items before you face up back to back against the entirety of Olympos XII.

### Best Digimon Progression

Best Team

#### Best Digimon For Early-Game

Every Rookie Digimon is pretty balanced when it comes to their Attacks, mainly focusing on just dealing damage. We recommend getting more Vaccine Attribute Digimon at this point in the game as most of the bosses will be Virus Attribute.

#### Best Digimon For Mid-Game



##### Champion Level

Before Agent Rank 3, you will be mostly using Champion Level Digimon. Notable ones like Raptordramon already have the best Attack effect in the game, which is to inflict debuffs while also dealing damage.List of Champion Digimon

##### Ultimate Level

After Agent Rank 5, you will now have access to Ultimate Level Digimon. At this point, your team should have specific Digimon of certain roles that you can feely switch in and out depending on the situation.List of Ultimate Digimon

#### Best Digimon For End-Game

After Agent Rank 7, you will now have access to Mega Level Digimon. You should focus on honing your team, fully planning out their strengths, and covering their weaknesses against the final stretch of the game.List of Mega Digimon

#### Best Digimon For Post-Game

You should finish the game by atleast Agent Rank 8which will give access to both forms of Jupitermon and Chronomon, try to finish up the Arena Battles and finish any sidemissions you may have missed or you can also start a New Game Plus with these digimon in your party.List of Mega+ Digimon
