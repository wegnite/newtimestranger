### All Missables and Points of No Return



#### You Cannot Reset Agent Skills

Once you unlock an Agent Skill, you cannot respec and refund your Anomaly Points. Decide carefully which Agent Skill to unlock first before using your Anomaly Points.

Best Agent Skills

##### Load an Earlier Save to Reset Agent Skill

The only workaround to reset any unlocked Agent Skill is by saving your game first before spending your Anomaly Points on a skill.

This allows you to load from the previous save and decide on a different Agent Skill to unlock instead.
