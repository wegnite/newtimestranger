### How to Farm Money (Yen)

- Defeat Enemy Digimon
- Complete The Hall of Gold Outer Dungeon
- Complete Side Missions
- Sell Items

#### Defeat Enemy Digimon

You earn money (Yen) each time you defeat enemy Digimon in random encounters. This method may take time as you need to wait for enemy Digimon on the field to respawn.

#### Complete The Hall of Gold DLC Outer Dungeon

One of the most reliable ways to earn Money is to complete The Hall of Gold Outer Dungeon. Fight battles to earn as much Yen as you need and to level up your Digimon.

You can access the Outer Dungeons when you speak with Mirei Mikagura at The In-Between Theater.

Note that you need to buy the separate Outer Dungeons DLC to access this feature. These are not included in the Standard, Deluxe, and Ultimate Editions of the game.

#### Complete Side Missions

Side missions reward you with Money alongside items and attachments. You can check the rewards given by a side mission on the Missions menu on your Digivice.

#### Sell Items

You can also sell your items, such as jewels, to earn Money. However, this is not a recommended method as most of the items can be used to craft Digi-Eggs and Digimon Spirits.
