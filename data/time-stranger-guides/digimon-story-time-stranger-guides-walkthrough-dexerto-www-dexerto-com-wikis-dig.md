Welcome to your all-in-one hub for Digimon Story Time Stranger. Below, you’ll find the essential information, including clean tables for editions and prices, a quick primer on the world and cast, plus every confirmed feature and system so far.

Digimon Story Time Stranger will be released on October 3, 2025, and is set to launch for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam.

Digimon Story Time Stranger is a narrative-driven RPG set across modern Tokyo and the Digital World server Iliad.

You play as an ADAMAS agent investigating time anomalies, bouncing between past and future while partnering with Digimon to stop a looming collapse. The story leans on Iliad’s guardians, the Olympos XII, and a mysterious gate overseen by Junomon.

No matter which edition you pick, all pre-orders will include bonuses: Uniform of a certain school, Black Agumon, Black Gabumon, and the adventure item set.

Grab the free demo on the following platforms:

It lets you explore early Human-world and Iliad areas, try battles with CP team attacks and Analyze, use Regeneration Mode to refill HP and SP by standing still, open fights with a free Digi Attack that also breaks barriers and crates, and sample new status effects.

It plays offline with save transfer confirmed.

Over 450 are in, with more added post-launch via DLC packs.

Yes. There are in-game outfit variants shown outside paid packs.

Black Agumon and Black Gabumon are preorder bonuses with special routes.

Past Bandai practice suggests later standalone access, but the preorder is the early path.
