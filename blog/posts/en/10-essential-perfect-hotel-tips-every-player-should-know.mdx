## Basic Tips for Beginners

### 1. Start Small, Think Big
When you first begin, you’ll have limited resources and a small hotel. Focus on welcoming guests, cleaning rooms, and earning money. Don’t rush to expand—build a solid foundation first.

### 2. Prioritize Room Upgrades
The more rooms you have, the more guests you can accommodate. As soon as you have enough money, unlock new rooms. This will increase your income and help you grow faster.

### 3. Keep Rooms Clean
Guests won’t stay in dirty rooms, so always clean up after they leave. Quick cleaning ensures you can welcome the next guest without delay, maximizing your earnings.

## Intermediate Strategies

### 4. Hire Staff Wisely
As your hotel grows, you’ll need help managing tasks. Hire staff for cleaning, maintenance, and other activities. This reduces your workload and lets you focus on bigger decisions.

### 5. Decorate and Renovate
A beautiful hotel attracts more guests. Use decorations and renovations to improve the look of your hotel. Not only does this make your hotel more appealing, but it can also increase guest satisfaction.

### 6. Save for Big Upgrades
While it’s tempting to spend money on small upgrades, save up for major improvements like new floors or luxury amenities. These will significantly boost your hotel’s reputation and income.

Pay attention to how guests move through your hotel. Place amenities like vending machines and lounges in convenient locations to keep them happy and reduce wait times.

### 8. Focus on Guest Needs
Different guests have different needs. Some may want a quick stay, while others prefer luxury. Cater to their preferences by offering a variety of room types and services.

### 9. Expand Strategically
When you’re ready to expand, choose locations that attract more guests. For example, building near popular attractions or in busy areas can increase your hotel’s visibility and income.

The layout of your hotel can make a big difference. Try different arrangements to see what works best. For example, placing rooms close to amenities can improve guest satisfaction.
