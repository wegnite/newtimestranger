## Basic Tips for Beginners

### 1. **Start with Explore Mode**
If you‚Äôre new to Stick Run, begin with **Explore Mode**. This mode allows you to familiarize yourself with the game mechanics without the pressure of endless running. Take your time to learn how to jump, dodge obstacles, and collect gold.

### 2. **Master the Jump Timing**
Timing is everything in Stick Run. Practice jumping over gaps and obstacles by pressing the spacebar (or tap on mobile) at the right moment. Too early or too late, and you‚Äôll fall out of the tunnel. Start with small jumps and gradually tackle larger gaps.

### 3. **Collect Gold Strategically**
Gold is your ticket to unlocking new Stickman characters. While it‚Äôs tempting to grab every coin you see, focus on collecting gold that‚Äôs easy to reach. Avoid risky maneuvers that could end your run prematurely.

## Intermediate Strategies

### 4. **Use the Environment to Your Advantage**
The tunnels in Stick Run are filled with twists, turns, and hidden paths. Pay attention to the layout and use walls or curves to slow down your Stickman when needed. This can help you navigate tricky sections more easily.

### 5. **Experiment with Different Characters**
As you progress, you‚Äôll unlock new Stickman characters, each with unique abilities. Some characters may run faster, jump higher, or have better control. Experiment with different characters to find the one that suits your playstyle.

### 6. **Stay Calm Under Pressure**
In Infinite Mode, the environment changes constantly, and the pace can get intense. Stay calm and focused, even when the tunnels seem overwhelming. Panicking often leads to mistakes, so take a deep breath and keep your eyes on the path ahead.

## Advanced Techniques

### 7. **Learn the Patterns**
Infinite Mode may seem random, but there are patterns to the obstacles and tunnels. Pay attention to recurring layouts and memorize the best ways to navigate them. This knowledge will give you an edge in longer runs.

### 8. **Optimize Your Gold Collection**
In advanced stages, gold becomes harder to collect without risking your run. Focus on grabbing gold that‚Äôs directly in your path and avoid detours. Every coin counts, but survival is more important.

### 9. **Use Shortcuts Wisely**
Some tunnels have hidden shortcuts that can save you time or help you avoid difficult sections. Keep an eye out for alternative paths, but be cautious‚Äîshortcuts can sometimes lead to dead ends or tricky obstacles.
