   Farming is a great way to ensure a steady food supply. Plant seeds and harvest crops like wheat, carrots, and potatoes.

3. **Create a Mine**  
   Dig deep to find valuable ores like iron, gold, and diamonds. Always bring torches and a pickaxe when mining.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Ignoring the Night**

   Avoid crafting unnecessary items early in the game. Focus on essential tools and weapons first.

3. **Not Saving Progress**  
   While Miniblox automatically saves your progress, always log out properly to avoid losing your work.

   In Multiplayer mode, respect other players’ builds and collaborate instead of causing chaos.
