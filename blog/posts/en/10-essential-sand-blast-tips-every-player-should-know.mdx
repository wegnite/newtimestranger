## Basic Tips for Beginners

### 1. **Start with the Corners**
When you’re just starting out, it’s tempting to place blocks in the center of the grid. But here’s a pro tip: **start with the corners**. This gives the sand more room to flow and helps you avoid creating gaps early in the game. Plus, it sets you up for easier line clears as the game progresses.

### 2. **Focus on One Color at a Time**
While it’s tempting to mix and match colors, try to **focus on one color at a time**. This makes it easier to fill complete rows and clear them for points. If you see a block that matches the color you’re working on, prioritize placing it in a spot that will help complete a line.

### 3. **Save Your Bomb Blocks**
Bomb blocks are your best friend when things get tight, but don’t use them too early. **Save them for emergencies** when you’re running out of space or need to clear a stubborn section of the grid. A well-timed bomb can save your game!

## Intermediate Strategies

### 4. **Plan Ahead with Your Block Choices**
You’re given three blocks at a time, so **think ahead** about how each one will affect the grid. Ask yourself: *Where will the sand flow? Will this move create a gap?* Planning just one or two moves ahead can make a huge difference in your score.

### 5. **Use the Grid’s Height to Your Advantage**
The sand flows downward, so **use the grid’s height to your advantage**. Place blocks higher up to give the sand more room to spread out. This not only helps with line clears but also prevents the grid from filling up too quickly.

### 6. **Experiment with Block Shapes**
Each block has a unique shape, and some are better suited for certain situations than others. **Experiment with different shapes** to see how they interact with the sand. For example, a long, narrow block might be perfect for filling a gap, while a wider block could help you clear multiple lines at once.

## Advanced Techniques

### 7. **Create Cascading Clears**
One of the most satisfying moments in **Sand Blast** is when you trigger a **cascading clear**. This happens when clearing one line causes the sand above it to flow down and clear another line. To set this up, try to create multiple nearly-complete lines stacked on top of each other. A single well-placed block can set off a chain reaction!

### 8. **Balance Risk and Reward**
As the grid fills up, you’ll need to take calculated risks. Sometimes, placing a block in a tricky spot can lead to a big payoff, but it could also backfire. **Weigh the risks and rewards** of each move, and don’t be afraid to take a chance if it means clearing multiple lines.

### 9. **Master the Art of Bomb Placement**
Bomb blocks aren’t just for clearing space—they can also be used strategically to **set up cascading clears**. Try to place bombs in areas where they’ll clear multiple colors or create a path for sand to flow. A well-placed bomb can turn a losing game into a winning one.

## Pro Player Secrets

### 10. **Practice, Practice, Practice**
Like any great game, **Sand Blast** rewards practice. The more you play, the better you’ll get at predicting how the sand will flow and where to place your blocks. Don’t get discouraged if you don’t hit a high score right away. Keep playing, and you’ll see your skills improve over time.
