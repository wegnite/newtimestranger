### Basic Controls
The controls are straightforward:  
- **Tap to Flap:** Each tap makes the basketball move upward.  
- **Avoid the Ground:** If the ball touches the ground, it’s game over.

### Game Modes
Flappy Dunk offers a single-player mode where you can practice and improve your skills. The game also features leaderboards, so you can compete with friends and players worldwide.

## Core Gameplay Mechanics

### Timing is Everything
The key to success in Flappy Dunk is mastering the timing of your taps. Tap too early or too late, and you’ll miss the hoop or hit the ground. Practice finding the right rhythm to keep the ball in the air.

### Progressive Difficulty
As you score more points, the game becomes increasingly challenging. Hoops move faster, and obstacles appear, requiring sharper reflexes and better control.

### Scoring System
Each successful pass through a hoop earns you one point. Your goal is to score as many points as possible without making a mistake. Aim for a high score and climb the leaderboards!

## Advanced Strategies

### Develop a Rhythm
Consistency is crucial in Flappy Dunk. Try to develop a steady tapping rhythm that keeps the ball at the right height. This will help you navigate through hoops more easily.

### Anticipate Hoop Movement
As the game progresses, hoops start moving faster and in different patterns. Pay attention to their movement and adjust your taps accordingly.

### Stay Calm Under Pressure
It’s easy to panic when the game speeds up, but staying calm will help you make better decisions. Take deep breaths and focus on your timing.

## Tips and Tricks

### Practice Makes Perfect
The more you play, the better you’ll get. Spend time practicing to improve your reflexes and timing.

### Use Short Taps
Instead of long, forceful taps, use short, quick taps to control the ball more precisely.

### Watch for Patterns
Hoops often follow specific patterns. Observing these patterns can help you predict their movement and plan your taps.

### Take Breaks
If you’re struggling to improve, take a short break. Sometimes, stepping away from the game can help you come back with a fresh perspective.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Over-Tapping
Tapping too frequently can cause the ball to rise too high, making it harder to control. Stick to short, deliberate taps.

### Ignoring Obstacles
As the game progresses, obstacles like moving hoops or barriers will appear. Always be aware of your surroundings to avoid them.

### Getting Frustrated
It’s easy to get frustrated when you’re not improving, but remember that Flappy Dunk is meant to be challenging. Stay patient and keep practicing.
