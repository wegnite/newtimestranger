## **Basic Tips for Beginners**

### 1. **Master the Controls First**
Before jumping into the challenges, take time to familiarize yourself with the controls. Use the arrow keys to move the excavator and the mouse to control the magnetic arm. Practice holding and releasing packages to get a feel for the mechanics. Remember, precision is key!

### 2. **Start Slow and Steady**
Rushing through levels can lead to mistakes. Take your time to plan your moves and execute them carefully. A steady hand will save you from dropping packages or hitting obstacles.

### 3. **Use the Restart Button Wisely**
Made a mistake? Donâ€™t worry! Press the **R** key to restart the round. Itâ€™s better to reset early than to waste time trying to fix a messy situation.

## **Intermediate Strategies**

### 4. **Plan Your Moves Ahead**
Each level has its own set of challenges. Before making any moves, take a moment to assess the layout. Identify obstacles, switches, and the best path to the truck. Planning ahead will save you time and frustration.

### 5. **Rotate Packages for Better Fit**
Sometimes, packages need to be rotated to fit into the truck. Use the mouse to rotate them before dropping them into place. This is especially useful in tighter spaces or when dealing with oddly shaped obstacles.

### 6. **Watch Out for Physics**
Truck Loaderâ€™s realistic physics can make controlling the arm tricky. Be mindful of momentum and gravity when moving packages. A sudden movement can cause packages to swing or fall, so move smoothly and deliberately.

## **Advanced Techniques**

### 7. **Use Obstacles to Your Advantage**
Obstacles arenâ€™t always a hindranceâ€”they can be tools! For example, use raised platforms to position packages higher or leverage switches to open doors. Think creatively to turn challenges into opportunities.

### 8. **Prioritize Heavy Packages**
In later levels, youâ€™ll encounter heavier packages that are harder to control. Focus on moving these first, as they require more precision and effort. Lighter packages can be handled quickly afterward.

### 9. **Practice Precision in Tight Spaces**
As levels become more complex, youâ€™ll face tighter spaces and narrower paths. Practice moving packages with pinpoint accuracy to avoid collisions. Small adjustments can make a big difference.

## **Pro Player Secrets**

### 10. **Learn from Mistakes**
Every mistake is a learning opportunity. If you fail a level, analyze what went wrong and adjust your strategy. Over time, youâ€™ll develop a better understanding of the gameâ€™s mechanics and improve your skills.

### 11. **Experiment with Different Approaches**
Thereâ€™s often more than one way to solve a puzzle. Donâ€™t be afraid to try different methods to find the most efficient solution. Experimentation can lead to unexpected breakthroughs.

### 12. **Stay Calm Under Pressure**
Higher levels can be stressful, but staying calm is crucial. Take deep breaths, focus on the task at hand, and avoid rushing. A clear mind will help you make better decisions.
