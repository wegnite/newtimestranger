## **Basic Tips for Beginners**

### 1. **Master the Controls**
The controls in **Space Road** are simple but require precision. You canâ€™t control the speed of your spaceship, but you can steer it by dragging your mouse left or right. Practice moving smoothly and avoid sudden jerks, as they can throw you off course.

### 2. **Start Slow, Aim for Consistency**
When youâ€™re just starting out, focus on staying alive rather than going for high scores. Take your time to understand the gameâ€™s mechanics and get comfortable with the movement. Consistency is key to progressing further.

### 3. **Watch Out for Obstacles**
Meteors, moving walls, and other hazards will test your reflexes. Always keep an eye on the road ahead and anticipate obstacles. Reacting quickly can mean the difference between survival and a crash.

## **Intermediate Strategies**

### 4. **Collect Sparkling Items**
As you navigate the cosmos, youâ€™ll come across sparkling items. These are not just for showâ€”they help you unlock new ships and trails. Make it a habit to collect them whenever possible, but donâ€™t risk your life for them.

### 5. **Learn the Patterns**
While the game is fast-paced, many obstacles follow predictable patterns. Pay attention to these patterns and use them to your advantage. For example, if you notice meteors appearing in a specific sequence, plan your movements accordingly.

### 6. **Use the Environment**
The narrow canyons in **Space Road** can be both a challenge and a tool. Use the walls to your advantage by staying close to them when navigating tight spaces. This can help you avoid incoming obstacles more easily.

## **Advanced Techniques**

Timing is everything in **Space Road**. Instead of reacting to obstacles as they appear, try to anticipate them and plan your movements in advance. This proactive approach will help you stay one step ahead.

### 8. **Focus on the Center**
While itâ€™s tempting to hug the walls, staying in the center of the road gives you more room to maneuver. This is especially useful when dealing with multiple obstacles at once.

### 9. **Experiment with Different Ships**
As you progress, youâ€™ll unlock new ships with unique abilities. Experiment with different ships to find one that suits your playstyle. Some ships may offer better control, while others might have faster speeds.
