## Basic Tips for Beginners

### 1. **Master the Controls**
Before hitting the highway, familiarize yourself with the controls. Use the **W or UP arrow** to accelerate, **S or LEFT arrow** to turn left, **D or RIGHT arrow** to turn right, and the **Spacebar** to brake. Smooth and precise movements are key to avoiding collisions.

### 2. **Start Slow, Then Speed Up**
As a beginner, itâ€™s tempting to go full throttle right away. However, starting at a moderate speed allows you to get a feel for the traffic patterns. Once youâ€™re comfortable, gradually increase your speed to earn more points.

### 3. **Focus on Overtaking**
Overtaking vehicles is one of the easiest ways to earn cash. Try to pass as many cars as possible without crashing. The closer you pass, the more money youâ€™ll earn!

## Intermediate Strategies

### 4. **Upgrade Your Vehicle**
Use the cash you earn to upgrade your carâ€™s **speed**, **acceleration**, and **handling**. A faster and more responsive vehicle will make it easier to navigate through traffic and complete missions.

### 5. **Complete Missions for Extra Cash**
Traffic Racer offers various missions, such as driving a certain distance or overtaking a specific number of cars. Completing these missions not only boosts your earnings but also helps you improve your skills.

### 6. **Use Two-Way Mode to Your Advantage**
In two-way mode, driving in the opposite direction can earn you extra points and cash. However, be cautious of oncoming traffic and avoid head-on collisions.

## Advanced Techniques

### 7. **Drive Close to Other Vehicles**
Driving at high speeds (over 100 km/h) and passing closely to other cars can significantly increase your score. This technique requires precision and quick reflexes, so practice it in less crowded areas first.

### 8. **Plan Your Route**
Instead of randomly weaving through traffic, plan your route ahead of time. Look for gaps between cars and anticipate their movements to avoid sudden braking or swerving.

### 9. **Use Brakes Wisely**
While speeding is essential, knowing when to brake is equally important. Use the **Spacebar** to slow down when approaching tight spaces or sudden traffic jams. Overusing the brake can cost you valuable time and points.

## Pro Player Secrets

### 10. **Master the Art of Drifting**
Drifting around corners can help you maintain speed and avoid collisions. To drift, turn sharply while holding the **Spacebar** to slide through tight spaces. This technique takes practice but can give you an edge over other players.

### 11. **Experiment with Different Vehicles**
Each vehicle in Traffic Racer has unique stats. Experiment with different cars to find one that suits your driving style. Faster cars are great for high scores, while more stable cars are better for beginners.

### 12. **Stay Calm Under Pressure**
As the traffic gets heavier, itâ€™s easy to panic and make mistakes. Stay calm, focus on the road, and trust your instincts. Remember, practice makes perfect!
