## Tips and Tricks

### Start Slow
If you’re new to Egg Dash, start with the easier levels to get a feel for the gameplay. Once you’re comfortable, you can move on to the more challenging levels.

### Use Short Jumps
Sometimes, a short jump is all you need to avoid an obstacle. Practice making small, controlled jumps to navigate tight spaces.

### Take Breaks
Egg Dash can be addictive, but it’s important to take breaks to avoid frustration. If you’re stuck on a level, step away for a few minutes and come back with a fresh perspective.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Overcomplicating Jumps
One of the most common mistakes in Egg Dash is trying to make big, complicated jumps when a simple one would do. Keep your jumps short and precise to avoid unnecessary risks.

### Ignoring the Music
The background music in Egg Dash is there to help you. Ignoring it can make the game much harder. Use the rhythm to guide your jumps and stay in sync with the level.

### Rushing Through Levels
Egg Dash is a game of precision, not speed. Rushing through levels will only lead to mistakes. Take your time, and focus on making each jump count.
