## Getting Started

Before you jump into the game, here’s what you need to know to get started:

1. **Controls**: The game uses simple touch controls. Move around by swiping, interact with objects by tapping, and crouch to hide from Granny.
2. **Objective**: Your main goal is to escape the house within five days. Each day, you’ll have limited time to explore and solve puzzles.
3. **Items**: Look for keys, tools, and other items that will help you unlock doors, disable traps, and progress through the game.
4. **Granny**: Be careful! Granny is always listening and watching. Make too much noise, and she’ll come running.

## Core Gameplay Mechanics

Understanding the core mechanics is key to surviving in **Granny 2**. Here’s what you need to know:

### Exploration

The house is a maze of rooms, hallways, and hidden passages. Take your time to explore every corner. Look for items like keys, screwdrivers, and hammers that will help you progress. Remember, some items are hidden in drawers, under beds, or behind paintings.

### Puzzles

Puzzles are a big part of the game. You’ll need to solve them to unlock doors, disable traps, and find hidden items. Pay attention to clues scattered around the house. For example, a note might hint at the combination to a locked safe.

### Stealth

Granny’s hearing is sharp. Avoid making noise by walking slowly or crouching. If you drop an item or run, she’ll hear you and come to investigate. Use hiding spots like closets or under beds to avoid getting caught.

### Traps

The house is filled with deadly traps. Some are obvious, like bear traps on the floor, while others are hidden. Use tools like the screwdriver to disable traps and make your escape safer.

## Advanced Strategies

Once you’ve mastered the basics, these advanced strategies will help you survive longer and escape faster:

### Plan Your Route

Before you start exploring, plan your route. Know where the key items are and the quickest way to get to them. This will save you time and reduce the risk of running into Granny.

### Use Distractions

Granny is attracted to noise. Use this to your advantage by throwing objects to create distractions. For example, throw a bottle to lure her away from your path.

### Manage Your Time

You only have five days to escape, so manage your time wisely. Focus on finding the most important items first, like keys and tools. Don’t waste time exploring areas that don’t help your progress.

### Learn Granny’s Patterns

Granny has a routine. She moves around the house in a predictable pattern. Learn her movements and use this knowledge to avoid her. For example, if you know she’s in the kitchen, avoid that area until she moves on.

## Tips and Tricks

Here are some additional tips to help you survive:

- **Save Your Progress**: Use the save points to save your progress. This way, if you get caught, you won’t lose all your progress.
- **Use Headphones**: The game’s sound design is crucial. Use headphones to hear Granny’s footsteps and other sounds that can alert you to danger.
- **Stay Calm**: It’s easy to panic when Granny is nearby, but staying calm will help you think clearly and make better decisions.
- **Experiment**: Don’t be afraid to try different strategies. What works in one playthrough might not work in another.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

Even experienced players can make mistakes. Here are some common ones to avoid:

- **Running Too Much**: Running makes noise and attracts Granny. Only run when absolutely necessary.
- **Ignoring Clues**: The game is filled with clues that can help you solve puzzles. Don’t ignore them.
- **Not Hiding**: If Granny is nearby, hide immediately. Don’t try to outrun her; it rarely works.
- **Wasting Time**: Time is limited. Don’t spend too much time in one area. Focus on finding the items you need and moving on.

## Conclusion

**Granny 2** is a thrilling horror game that will test your nerves and problem-solving skills. With this complete guide, you’ll be well-equipped to survive the haunted house and escape Granny’s clutches. Remember to explore carefully, solve puzzles, and stay stealthy.
