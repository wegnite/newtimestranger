The key is to identify which ropes are on top and can be moved freely.\r\n2.  **Select the Bobbin:** Tap on a bobbin at the bottom to pull its matching colored rope from the tangle.\r\n3.  **Clear the Board:** Continue matching ropes to bobbins until the board is clear to complete the level.\r\n\r\n## Expert Strategies to Master the Tangle\r\n\r\nFeeling tied up in knots? These expert strategies will help you unravel even the most complex puzzles.\r\n\r\n### 1. Plan Your Moves\r\nBefore you make a single move, take a moment to analyze the entire puzzle. Identify the top-most ropes and trace their paths. A little planning can prevent you from getting stuck later on.\r\n\r\n### 2. Work from Front to Back\r\nAlways try to clear the ropes that are on top of the pile first. This will free up the ropes underneath and open up more possibilities. Pulling a rope from the bottom of the pile can often create more tangles.\r\n\r\n### 3. Color is Key\r\nSome levels use very similar shades, which can be tricky. Make sure your screen brightness is up to help distinguish between different colors. In later levels, correctly identifying the subtle differences is crucial.\r\n\r\n### 4. Stuck on a Level?
